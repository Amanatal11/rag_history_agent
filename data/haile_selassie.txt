Emperor Haile Selassie ruled Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 and is recognized for his efforts to modernize the country and promote international cooperation. He introduced constitutional reforms, expanded education, and improved infrastructure. Haile Selassie advocated for the abolition of slavery and worked to centralize government authority.

In 1936, following the Italian invasion, Haile Selassie delivered a historic speech to the League of Nations, appealing for international support against fascist aggression. Although Ethiopia was occupied by Italy until 1941, Haile Selassie returned to power after World War II and continued his modernization agenda.

Haile Selassie played a key role in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity (now African Union) in 1963, promoting African solidarity and independence. His reign faced challenges, including political unrest, economic difficulties, and demands for reform. In 1974, Haile Selassie was overthrown by the Derg regime, ending the Solomonic Dynastyâ€™s rule. He remains a symbol of Ethiopian unity and resilience.
