The Ethiopian Civil War began in 1974 with the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie and the rise of the Derg regime. The conflict was driven by opposition to the Derg’s authoritarian rule, ethnic tensions, and demands for regional autonomy. Major rebel groups included the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, and the Oromo Liberation Front.

The war was characterized by intense fighting, shifting alliances, and widespread human rights abuses. The Red Terror campaign resulted in mass killings and repression of dissent. Famine in the mid-1980s, exacerbated by war and government policies, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and drew international attention.

Key battles occurred in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with rebel forces gradually gaining ground. By 1991, the Derg regime collapsed, and the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front took control of Addis Ababa. The civil war led to the independence of Eritrea in 1993 and significant changes in Ethiopia’s political landscape. The conflict’s legacy includes deep social divisions and ongoing challenges to national unity.
