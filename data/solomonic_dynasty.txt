The Solomonic Dynasty was restored in 1270 by Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. This dynasty ruled Ethiopia for over six centuries, shaping the country’s political, religious, and cultural identity. The Solomonic rulers emphasized their legitimacy through genealogical ties to biblical figures, reinforcing the connection between the monarchy and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.

Key rulers included Emperor Menelik II, who led Ethiopia to victory at the Battle of Adwa in 1896, and Emperor Haile Selassie, who modernized the country and played a prominent role in international affairs. The dynasty faced numerous internal and external challenges, including wars with neighboring states, succession disputes, and European colonial ambitions.

The Solomonic Dynasty contributed to the development of Ethiopian literature, art, and architecture. It supported the expansion of Christianity and the construction of churches and monasteries. The dynasty’s rule ended in 1974 when Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed by the Derg regime, marking the end of Ethiopia’s imperial era.
