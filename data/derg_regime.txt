The Derg regime came to power in Ethiopia in 1974 after overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie. The Derg, a military committee, established a socialist government and abolished the monarchy. Led by Mengistu Haile Mariam, the regime implemented radical land reforms and nationalized industries.

The Derg’s rule was marked by political repression and violence, most notably during the Red Terror campaign from 1977 to 1978. Thousands of suspected opponents were imprisoned, tortured, or executed. The regime faced armed resistance from various groups, including the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front.

Ethiopia experienced severe economic challenges, famine, and ongoing conflict during the Derg era. The government’s policies and internal divisions contributed to instability and humanitarian crises. The Derg remained in power until 1991, when rebel forces captured Addis Ababa and ended the regime. The legacy of the Derg includes widespread suffering and significant social and political changes.
