Modern Ethiopia emerged after the fall of the Derg regime in 1991. The new government established a federal system based on ethnic regions, aiming to address historical grievances and promote self-governance. The Ethiopian Peopleâ€™s Revolutionary Democratic Front led the transition, drafting a new constitution in 1995.

Ethnic politics have played a major role in shaping contemporary Ethiopia. While federalism has provided autonomy to regions, it has also fueled competition and occasional conflict among ethnic groups. The country has faced challenges related to political reform, human rights, and economic development.

Ethiopia has experienced rapid growth in infrastructure, education, and health services since the 2000s. Major projects include the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and expansion of transportation networks. However, the nation continues to confront issues such as poverty, unemployment, and periodic unrest. In the 21st century, Ethiopia has played an active role in regional diplomacy and peacekeeping, while navigating complex internal dynamics and aspirations for stability and prosperity.
