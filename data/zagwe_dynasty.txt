The Zagwe Dynasty ruled Ethiopia from the late 10th century until the mid-13th century. Its origins are traced to the overthrow of the last Axumite king, leading to the rise of a new ruling family in the northern highlands. The Zagwe kings established their capital at Roha, later renamed Lalibela, and focused on consolidating power and promoting Christianity.

One of the dynasty’s most significant achievements was the construction of the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela. These churches, carved directly into the mountainside, were intended to create a “New Jerusalem” for Ethiopian Christians. The churches remain a UNESCO World Heritage site and are a testament to the dynasty’s architectural and religious legacy.

The Zagwe rulers maintained a centralized administration and supported monastic communities, which played a key role in education and religious life. The dynasty’s cultural contributions included the promotion of religious literature and the preservation of Christian traditions. The Zagwe period ended in the 1270s when the Solomonic Dynasty claimed the throne, asserting descent from the biblical King Solomon and Queen of Sheba.
